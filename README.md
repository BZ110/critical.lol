## **Overview**  
This is the raw code for my personal website, a **carrd-like** minimalist site built entirely from scratch. It's designed to be simple, sleek, and easy to customize for anyone!  

## **Features**  
This site includes several cool features, such as:  
- **A Start Button:** Users must press it to begin the experience.  
- **Background Music:** Music plays seamlessly while navigating the page.  
- **Profile Photo & Background:** A custom avatar and backdrop for personalization.  
- **Customizable Social Links:** Linked icons (SVGs) for platforms like GitHub, Discord, and X (Twitter).  
- **Lightweight & Fast:** No backend, no heavy frameworks - just clean, fast-loading code.  

## **How Customizable Is It?**  
Everything in this project is fully customizable! As long as you have a basic understanding of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,** you’ll be able to modify it easily.  
- Change the **profile picture** and **background** to your own.  
- Replace the **social links** with your own: `personality.js`
- Customize the **colors, fonts, and animations.**  
- Modify the **music player** to use your own tracks.  

## **Can You Use This for Your Own Site?**  
Yes! This is a **static website,** meaning it has no backend functionality - so you don't have to worry about security vulnerabilities from server-side code. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:  

### **1. Music Usage & Copyright**  
- If you’re adding music, make sure you have the **legal rights** to use it.  
- Some artists (like my fav. **Tanger**) allow free use for non-commercial purposes as long as they’re credited.  
- Avoid copyrighted songs to **prevent DMCA takedowns** or other legal issues.  

### **2. Security Best Practices**  
- Avoid storing **sensitive information** (like API keys) in the code.  
- If using third-party scripts, **verify they are from trusted sources** before including them.  
- Use secure hosting platforms like **GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify** to deploy your site.  

### **3. Browser Compatibility**  
- This project is designed to work on **modern browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).  
- Test your changes on multiple devices to ensure everything functions properly.  

## Known Issues
- (Fixed) GitHub Pages: Music Player controls are limited.
- (Fixed) Music player uses linear volume changing, I plan on making it an exponential function soon.

## **Please Credit Me ❤️**  
If you use this code for your own site, I’d appreciate a small credit! You can do this by:  
- **Linking back** to my original site: [critical.lol](https://critical.lol)  
- Adding a **small credit** somewhere on your page (e.g., "Original template by Critical <3")  
- Keeping my name in the source code comments if possible.
- Or doing nothing! Just don't change the bottom left "Made by Critical <3!" on the black start menu.

## **Thank You**  
This project was made for fun, but I hope it helps others looking for a **clean, minimal, and fast** personal site template. Feel free to fork it, modify it, and make it your own!
